            <div class="about_me">
                <p style="font-family: 'Numans', serif;color:#45A29E">My name is Tristan Kay and I am a film editor with 7 years of experience and 
                        am skillful in many programs. I have been involved in 
                        editing Dance recitals, Promotional Videos,
                        Short films, Gym exercise videos and Music Videos. 
                        I completed my early and secondary school education at Scotch College where I recieved full colours in Athletics and Rugby.
                        After school I continued my education and I received a Bachelor's degree in film and television at SAE Qantm. </br>
                        After university I followed my passion of film and focused mainly on film editing. 
                        My work received an award at the Dungog Film Festival and I have 
                        obtained many positive reviews for my editing. Focusing mainly on music videos, I have produced and edited over 10 
                        videos myself. </br>
                        My experience and confidence with coding will solidify myself as a vital member of many potential teams as I have skills in ruby,
                        html, css, and many more. I am also extremely interested in independent 
                        productions and collaborating with others to create intellectual property. 
                        Throughout my working career I have received skills in hospitality,  
                        government funded social research and inhouse film editing for 
                        ‘Big Review Tv’. Working with many other companies
                        has introduced me to multiple co-workers and their respective teams to 
                        show I can fit in. My passions see myself fixated on a computer screen 
                        but with my filming skills it shows I work well out of the computer room. 
                        My vast and award winning experience shows the incredibly capable worker that I am. </p>
