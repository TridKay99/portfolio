                <p style="font-family: 'Numans', sans-serif;, serif;color:#45A29E">A film editor with 7 years of experience. 
                        Involved in 
                        editing Dance recital videos, Promotional Videos,
                        Short films, Gym exercise videos and Music Videos. 
                        I complete my early and secondary school at Scotch College where I recieved full colours in Athletics and Rugby.
                        And received a Bachelor's degree in film and television at SAE Qantm. </br>
                        After university I followed my passion of film and focused mainly on film editing. 
                        My editing has received an award at the Dungog Film Festival and have 
                        obtained many positive reviews for my work. Focusing mainly on music videos, I have produced and edited over 10 
                        videos myself. </br>
                        My experience and confidence with coding with solidify myself as a vital member of many potential teams as I have skills in ruby,
                        html, css, and many more. I am  also extremely interested in independent 
                        productions and collaborating with others to create intellectual property. 
                        Throughout my working career I have received skills in hospitality,  
                        government funded social research and inhouse film editing for company 
                        ‘Big Review Tv’. Working with many other companies
                        has introduced me to multiple co-workers and their respective teams to 
                        show I can fit in. My passions see myself fixated on a computer screen 
                        but with my filming skills it shows I work well out of the computer room. 
                        My vast and award winning experience shows the incredibly capable worker. </p>
